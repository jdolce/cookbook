  - bread
yield: 2
prepTime: 20
cookTime: 180

ingredients:
- 550g All Purpose or Bread Flour
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 2 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast
- 2 1/2 teaspoons table salt
- 1 2/3 cups warm water 95˚F-110˚F
- cornmeal, for coating the pan

directions:
- These directions reflect my oven and experience. See recipe link for original instructions.
- Stir all ingredients (except cornmeal) together in stand mixer bowl
- Use paddle attachment to bring dough together into a rough shaggy mess.
- Using dough hook beat on medium power for 7 mins. If dough doesn't clean the sides of the bowl add a little more flour.
- Place dough in greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap
- Let rise for 1-2 hours or until doubled in size 
- Gently deflate dough and divide into 2
- Pat each into 6" x 8" oval
- Working with one piece of dough at a time, grab a short side and fold the dough like a business letter (one short side into the center, the other short side over it). Use the heel of your hand to press the open edge of the “letter” closed. Gently pat and roll the dough into a log about 10” long. Repeat with the remaining piece of dough.
- Place the loaves, seam-side down, on a baking sheet (lined with parchment if desired). Sprinkle the pan (or parchment) generously with cornmeal; this will keep the bread from sticking and give it a crunchy bottom crust.
- Let the loaves rise, lightly covered with greased plastic wrap, for 45 minutes. They should become nicely puffy. Gently poke your index finger into the side of one of the loaves; if the indentation remains, your bread is ready to bake.
- Towards end of rise - Preheat oven to convention 425˚F
- While the oven is preheating, place an empty cast-iron frying pan on the lowest rack. Bring 1 cup of water to a boil in the microwave or on the stovetop.
- When your bread is risen, use a sieve to dust the loaves with a thin coat of flour. Then make three or four 1/2” deep diagonal slashes in each loaf; these slashes will help the bread rise evenly as it bakes. Place the bread in the oven and pour the boiling water into the frying pan below. Quickly shut the oven door. Wear good oven mitts during this process to shield your hands and arms from the steam.
- Bake the bread for 30 minutes, until the crust is golden brown and a loaf sounds hollow to the touch when you tap it on the bottom. The interior temperature of the bread should register at least 190°F on a digital thermometer.
- Turn the oven off, crack the door open, and allow the bread to remain inside for 5 additional minutes; this helps keep the crust crisp. Remove the bread from the oven and cool it on a rack. It’s best not to cut into the bread until it’s cooled down a bit; cutting into hot bread can negatively affect its texture.
